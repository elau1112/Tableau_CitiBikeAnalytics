Report on the Citi Bike Analytics
Study period: Jan 2018 to April 2021

This report consists of three main sections:
A) Citi Bike Usage Characteristics
    > Ridership: >10% growth in 2019 versus >15% drop in 2020. The number of recorded trips increased to ~405,000 in 2019. It dropped below 350,000 during the COVID pandemic in 2020. This is less than the 353,892 total in 2018. 
    > The average distance that a bike is ridden has been increased for over 10,000 miles in 2020 during the COVID pandemic although a reduced number of trips has been recorded.
    > Increased average trip duration was also observed in 2019 and 2020. By age, users above 80 years old had a big jump of average trip duration from ~0.3 hours in 2019 to >2.5 hours in 2020.
    > Peak season of ridership occurred around Q3 in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
    > During the summer months (June to August), peak hours of bike use occurred around 8:00am ad 6:00pm. The 6pm peak was observed across 2018, 2019 and 2020.
    > During the winter months (November to January), peak hours of bike use also occurred around 8:00am ad 6:00pm in the study years. However, the number of bike use is ~50% of the summer months only. This is probably due to the cold weather in winter.
    > "Bike use" was defined as the number of bike use with the start time recorded at the study hours.


B) Citi Bike User Characteristics
    > 2018 Male/Female ratio around the Citi Bike stations is around 0.71 to 0.97. However, male participation has been the majority in the region.

    > Proportion of female ridership has been increased constantly from ~21% in 2018 to ~23% in 2019. This was ~25% in 2020 despite the reduced number of user during the COVID pandemic.  
    
    > Further strategic follow-up and gender outreach could be targeted to further increase the female ridership and also the user groups with age >40 years old. Live events / campaign may target to take place around the "peak" season of Citi Bike usage, i.e. around June to August (e.g. "Summer Festival") and around November to January (e.g. "Thanksgiving Citi Bike events") of the year. This could then follow by a spring event for a "blossom bike ride" to increase the awareness. In addition, "healthy bike ride" for users with a need / preference on longer ride and trip duration.

    > Proportion of short-term customers has been increasing from ~6% in 2018 to ~11% in 2019 and ~31% in 2020. The significant drop in annual subscribers in 2020 could be due to the restricted access / use of Citi Bike during the COVID pandemic. The subscribed users might not be able to use the Citi Bike as they normally did. Thus, they might tend to switch from an annual subscriber type to a short-term customer type.  

C) Popular Citi Bike Stations in the City
   > The popularity of Citi Bike Stations during the study period is shown. Grove St. Path has been the most popular stations for starting and ending a journey during the study period. 
   > The marketing events could target for stations with a "middle" level popularity currently.
